E-ration_App v1.0

->This is my final year project where we developed an app based on Ration management system.

->This is an entry level app for PDS(public distribution system) where it provides various feature like geolocation, Todays activity , complaint forum & other feature.

->We developed this app using java programmng language, we used FIREBASE as our database & the environment used is Android Studio. ->It was a bit challenging and we completed in a given duration.

*************To the other developers *****************

This app only provide several feature those who clone the project can edit the project and commit it !

The Geolocation module might not work because we used API for that module and its paid version so it is necessary to update the API Key!!

New ideas are always welcome !!!
